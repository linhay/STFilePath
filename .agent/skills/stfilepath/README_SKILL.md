STFilePath skill - developer notes

How to use this skill

1. Read SKILL.md for quick guidance and triggers.
2. Open references/FILES.md to locate implementation and tests you need to change.
3. Use scripts/example_usage.swift as a starting point for README examples or small sample apps. Build it with `swift build` in the repo root.
4. Run `swift test` to validate existing tests after making changes.

Maintenance notes

- Keep SKILL.md description concise and ensure triggers mention "STFilePath" and common tasks (watcher, hashing, DownloadableFile).
- Update references/FILES.md when moving or renaming core sources.
